"""The CFDP module contains the low level components to create the CFDP packets as specfied in the
standard. It also contains basic enumerations and abstractions which were considered useful
and generic enough to be included. These abstractions can be used as a foundation to build
more complex classes and handlers to perform full CFDP end-to-end transfers.

These components can not be found in this library, but you can find a reference implementation
of high level handlers in the `tmtccmd <https://tmtccmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library.

You can find a usage example including multiple packet data units used to perform a full
unacknowledged file transfer on the :ref:`example <examples:CFDP Packets>` page.
